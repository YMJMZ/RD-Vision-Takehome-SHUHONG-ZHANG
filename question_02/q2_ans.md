For the first matrix, the eigenvalues are $\pm i$ and eigenvectors are $[1, i]$ and $[1, -i]$. Take this matrix as a rotation matrix and the rotation angle is 90 degrees. What is more the eigenvectors contain two real and images part. Take real parts and image parts as two new vectors ($[1,1]$ and $[1,-1]$). This two vectors indicate the rotation angle and scaling of this matrix. Specifically, from $[1,-1]$ to $[1,1]$, it rotates 90 degrees (counter-clockwise) and scales one time.

For the matrix, the eigenvalues are 1 and 2, as well as eigenvectors are $[1,0]$ and $[0,1]$. This two eigenvalues are the basis vectors in 2D space. Therefore, the matrix only expands the length of vectors but change its direction when it is multiplied on basis vectors. Specifically, the matrix does not affect the vectors on x-axis and double the vectors on y-axis.
